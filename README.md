# Randomized-Cryptographic-Algorithms
A code to deploy n no. of encryption algorithms without the user knowing which algorithm is used for encryption so that the attacker also is kept in shadow.

Here our rand() function generates random numbers in a given range so that the number associated with a particular algorithm runs the encryption algorithm on the data to be protected and get it encrypted multiple times with different algorithms to get a more anonymous encryption alternative.
 P.S- here only 2 algorihtms are used to make the code less complex.
